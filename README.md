# mpiman

Linux utility to quickly find manpages of mpi routines.

Originally intended for MPI C++ bindings, but also useful for the closely related python bindings in mpi4py, whose names can vary quite a bit from their C and Fortran counterparts, and also nice to get man pages when you don't remember or know the exact MPI routine name.

## Usage example: 

```
$ mpiman AllGather
```
